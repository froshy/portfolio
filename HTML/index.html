        <p><em>6/28/2022</em>- This site serves as my portfolio, a journal, and a progress tracker in my 
        web development journey. Here, I plan to use what I've learned in the days between updating my portfolio, however long that may be. 
        Because vscode does not give the helpful red squiggly under missppelled words, I would expect several spelling errors until I change 
        my code editor, to whatever it may be, if any better exist.</p>
        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p>It is currently the summer before my sophomore year at Cornell University. I am an aspiring CS student, although my current sophomore schedule
            does not reflect that. Intending to study electrical engineering, I took an introduction to engineering course on smartphones. Utilizing the function
            of these sorts of introductory classes to its full potential, I decided that electrical engineering is not for me, at least not a full committment towards
            it. I looked at our handy 
            <a href="https://cornellengineeringhandbook.freeflowdp.com/cornellengineeringhandbook/fall2021/MobilePagedReplica.action?pm=2&folio=Cover#pg1" target="_blank">Cornell Engineering Handbook</a> 
            to pick out another major: Operations Research. All I really know about this major is that it is a lot of statistical analysis and optimizing. After
            talking to my girlfriend who is looking into the finance
            and consulting field, I was decidedly convinced that I am not into finance, which many OR majors go into. Unfortunately, I had already made my sophomore
            schedule around this plan, so hopefully I will be able to snag my classes in the rat race that Cornell uses as an enrolling service.

        <h3>Experiences</h3>
        <p>So why am I so special? What separates me from any other person, any other computer science student? Honestly I have no idea,
            but hopefully in documenting my learning journey, it will become clear to me what special skillset that is unique to me. What special power
            I was born with. In the meantime, here is an <strong>UNORDERED LIST</strong> of my current work experience.
